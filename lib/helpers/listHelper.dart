        subtitle:
            """They are creatures of few “words” yet dogs communicate easily with canines everywhere, and with most humans. If you and your dog were to travel to a foreign country, knowing nothing of its language and culture, you would have a hard time communicating. You would have to abandon your vast verbal vocabulary and resort to making basic gestures — hoping that none of them are culturally offensive.
Your dog, however, upon meeting a foreign dog, would be able to know through body language what each other’s social status is, through sniffs their age and sex, what they ate, their general health, where they’ve been, and availability to mate. Then, should it be necessary, through barks or growls, they can also determine how friendly or aggressive the other dog is and how they should proceed with the relationship.
A dog’s primary communication is first through scent, then body language, and then his vocal sounds such as barking, growling and whining. In the wild, dogs bark to call the pack together, alert each other to danger or to a delightful food find. Dogs living with humans quickly figure out that communicating to us through scent is useless — we’ll never appreciate the detailed messages embedded in urine on a fencepost. So our dogs speak to us through body language, because we understand it fairly well, and through barking, because it definitely gets our attention.

The vocal sounds, though limited in the “words” which are barks, growls, whines, yips, yelps, whimpers and howls, are quite varied in the pitch, repetition and duration and these “inflections” form meaning. Generally, lower-pitched sounds are warnings and higher-pitched sounds are friendly. Regardless of your dog’s size, she knows if she lowers her voice, she may be perceived as being larger.

            """We feel tremendous love for our dogs, and our dogs sure seem to love us. But is it truly love or something else?
Are dogs really capable of emotions? Or are we just projecting our own love onto our dogs?
Scientists avoid the subject because part of what sets humans apart from other animals is our ability to experience feelings. To say that animals actually have feelings, in the same way we do, would change everything — perhaps disrupting our entire position and standing in the animal kingdom. 
However, any dog owner knows that dogs love completely and have a greater capacity for love than many people. If one were to describe the main characteristics of a dog, they would have to be:
1. Strong affection
2. Warm attachment
3. Unselfish loyalty and benevolent concern for others
Wait a minute — those are the Merriam-Webster Dictionary definitions of love. Probably why the author of Dogs Never Lie About Love, Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, writes, “Dogs are love.”
So there isn’t really a question of whether dogs love, the mystery is how they have such an enormous capacity for it. Dogs who are neglected or abused still show love for their humans and wag their tails in hope of a little affection."""),
    Section(
        title: "Dogs Give Unconditional Love",
        subtitle:
            """Dogs taken from abusive situations hold no grudges toward the human race. A half an ounce of kindness from a new person results in an abundance of affection from the formerly mistreated dog. Humans rarely have the capacity to so completely forgive and love under those circumstances. 
Probably the biggest reason dogs have become man’s best friend is because we know that when it comes to love, a dog can always outdo us. The highest form of love, agape love, which is completely unconditional, is something that people often have to work at or grow into. Agape love seems to come naturally between parent and child, but it’s more difficult between husband and wife, and harder still between friends. To love someone regardless of what wrongs they have done you can be very difficult for humans.
A dog, however, is born with an endless capacity for unconditional love, and doesn’t even have to work at it. You can be a complete grouch, ignore your dog, and refuse him your love. When you decide you’re ready to be sociable again, your dog doesn’t pay you back by ignoring you, too. He’s just happy you’re there. More amazing still, is that the love that dogs and owners feel for each other lasts a lifetime. This is the ideal love humans strive for, but often fail at.
As Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson so beautifully writes in Dogs Never Lie About Love, “Learning to know somebody intimately is often the beginnings of dislike, sometimes even of contempt. Among humans, love often does not survive a growing acquaintance, but in a dog, love seems to grow with acquaintance, to get stronger, deeper. Even when fully acquainted with all our weaknesses, our treachery, our unkindness, the dog seems to love strongly — and this dog love is returned by most humans. We, too, seem to love our dogs the more we get to know them. The bond grows between us and our dogs.”
This is why we need dogs. They do something for us that rarely a human companion can do. No matter how messy your life gets, no matter how many mistakes you make or how often you make them, regardless of your looks, income or social standing, your dog never judges you. He always thinks you are wonderful and loves you with all his heart.""")

The No. 1 rule for people food is: If you wouldn’t eat it, don’t feed it to your pet. This includes raw meat, fat or grease from cooked meat and questionably fresh or spoiled food. Before sharing your favorite foods with your dog, check with your veterinarian about toxicity, safety, preparation and amount to give him.

Always check whether veggies can be served raw like carrots and green beans.
Canned vegetables must have no or low salt.
Avoid giving your dog food that gives them gas like cabbage, limit dark leafy greens and broccoli.
Never give a dog spoiled, rotten, fermenting fruit.
Only serve a small slice of fruit every couple of weeks, make it last longer by freezing it.
Apples are great since they are healthy, available year-round and reasonably priced.
Never feed grapes or raisins, these are highly toxic.
Cooked grains like rice and barley: Leave out the butter and salt. Watch the quantity as grains are relatively high in calories.
Err on the side of caution if you choose to share food, serve a teaspoon or one slice only.
Do not give your dog lunchmeat or add seasoning to any food. Salt and other additives are not good for dogs. Good choices are chicken and turkey without the skin."""),

Instead, implement portion-control feeding, in which food is measured using a standard cooking cup to weigh the amount of food your veterinarian recommends for your pet’s daily intake. Feed your pet at the same times each day to regulate the digestive system and avoid accidents.

Typically, dogs prefer an element of privacy when they are eating. Put down the bowl of food and walk away. Leave the bowl down for 5-10 minutes (if your dog is a slow eater, this period can be extended to twenty minutes, but only if he is still eating during that time and hasn’t gone off in search of other entertainment), and then pick it up, regardless of whether your dog has eaten or not. While most dogs will dig in the moment you place the bowl on the floor, you may find that your adopted dog is a finicky eater, at least at first. After all, he’s been thrust into a new home with new people, and he may be too nervous to eat. If this is the case, you will need to teach him to eat on a schedule. Put the bowl back down at the next scheduled feeding, for 5-10 minutes. Your dog will learn to eat when you put the bowl down, and not to linger and nibble throughout the day.

Another benefit of set feedings is that a dog who eats on a schedule poops on a schedule. In addition, if you live in an urban area, leaving a bowl of kibble on the ground all day can attract unwanted house guests, like cockroaches and mice. It is to everyone’s advantage to keep feeding times regular.

Having regularly scheduled feeding times not only establishes a routine, it also allows you to monitor your dog’s health. Remember that sometimes the only way to recognize that your dog is ill is a lack of appetite. If your dog has his food down all day and usually just picks at it, it may be two or three days before you notice that he hasn’t eaten; whereas the dog that gobbles his meals as soon as you put the bowl down would be easy to recognize when he is ill.

Adult cats prefer as many as 8-16 small meals per day. This can be regulated using a timed feeder that opens to release a small meal."""),
